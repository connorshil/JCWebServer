Assumptions:
1. Port 8080 is open.
2. flask and flask_restful are installed. If they are not, they are easy to install with "pip install $" with [flask, flask_restful].
3. Python 3 is installed. To run this project I took the latest version of Python available (3.8).
4. Authentication is not a goal within the current project scope or is taken care of by a parent network.
6. Data persistence is not a goal within the current project scope.
